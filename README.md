Project Title: Python Geocoding with Geopy

Description:
This project harnesses the capabilities of Geopy, a Python library for geocoding and geographical calculations, to find longitude and latitude coordinates based on provided addresses or locations. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), enabling spatial analysis and visualization. In this repository, we provide Python scripts that utilize Geopy's decoders to perform geocoding tasks efficiently and accurately.

Key Features:

Utilizes Geopy library for geocoding tasks, offering access to multiple geocoding services.
Provides flexibility in input formats, allowing addresses or locations to be specified in various formats.
Utilizes Geopy's decoders to convert addresses into precise latitude and longitude coordinates.
Offers easy integration with existing Python projects or applications requiring geocoding functionality.
Supports batch geocoding for processing multiple addresses efficiently.
Dependencies:

Geopy: Python library for geocoding and geographical calculations.
Python 3.x: Programming language used for scripting and development.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure Geopy library is installed using pip install geopy.
Run the provided Python script for geocoding tasks.
Input addresses or locations as required and obtain corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates.
Customize the script to meet specific project requirements or integrate it into larger applications.
